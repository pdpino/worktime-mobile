Next things to do

## New Features

* View with sprints (for each work session)
* Archive/unarchive subjects
* Dashboard
  - save dates filter in store (also subjects selected?)
  - Add total time to the right of the bars

## Style

* Add some padding for items in subjects-list

## Develop
* Type-checking with flow
